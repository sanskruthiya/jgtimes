## üìù Contributing Articles

### For Contributors

You can contribute articles to JGTimes by adding markdown files to the `articles/en/` directory. The site automatically detects and displays new articles without any manual configuration.

For detailed submission instructions, please see the **[How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)** section below.

#### Article Requirements

Each article must be a markdown file (`.md`) with YAML frontmatter containing:

**Required metadata:**
- `title`: Article title
- `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

**Optional metadata:**
- `category`: Single category or array of categories (e.g., `service` or `[service, government]`)
- `description`: Brief article description
- `author`: Single author or array of authors (e.g., `"Eita.H"` or `["Eita.H", "Taro.S"]`)

#### Example Article Structure

```markdown
---
title: "Your Article Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
category: [service, government]
