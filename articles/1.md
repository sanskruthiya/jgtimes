Over the past 50 years, Japan has undergone a remarkable transformation, fueled by rapid economic growth that saw the development of roads, bridges, railways, airports, and other infrastructure. Since the 1990s, however, the nation has entered an "era of infrastructure maintenance." Both the national and local governments now face mounting financial pressure to sustain these "hard" infrastructure assets. For many, allocating budgets to address aging infrastructure and prioritizing proper maintenance has become an increasingly challenging task. Against this backdrop, geospatial technology in Japan has advanced as a critical tool for promoting the integration, sharing, and analysis of data to enable more effective infrastructure management.

Another key turning point in the development of geospatial technology in Japan was the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, which struck Kobe in 1995. This tragic disaster underscored the urgent need for improved disaster risk management. Given Japan's geographic, topographic, and climatic conditions, the country is prone to frequent natural disasters, including typhoons, heavy rains, snowstorms, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Drawing on these experiences, local governments have come to recognize the importance of sharing geospatial data across organizations to quickly assess disaster situations and make timely, well-informed decisions throughout the disaster response cycle.

In the wake of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, the Cabinet Office established the "GIS-Related Ministries Liaison Council" to promote the nationwide sharing of geospatial data through the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. This initiative laid the foundation for Japan's modern geospatial infrastructure, shaping how the nation leverages spatial data for better governance, disaster preparedness, and infrastructure management.
