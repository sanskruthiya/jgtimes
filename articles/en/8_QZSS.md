# Overview
Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), commonly known as **"Michibiki"**, is a high-precision satellite positioning system (GNSS: Global Navigation Satellite System) operated independently by Japan.
As the name **"quasi-zenith"** suggests, this satellite system is designed with an orbital configuration that ensures satellites are always visible near the zenith (directly overhead) from anywhere in Japan. This enables Japan to achieve **high-precision** and **stable positioning** throughout the country.
The Japanese word **"Michibiki"** literally means guidance, referring to "showing the path for people toward their destinations".

# Project Background
Generally speaking, the most well-known satellite positioning system (GNSS) in Japan is the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS).
However, Japan faced challenges in achieving stable positioning using GPS alone due to its geographical conditions, including dense high-rise buildings in urban areas and mountainous terrain in rural regions.[^1]
This led to the initiation of the Michibiki project as Japan's indigenous satellite system.
Due to this background, Michibiki has **GPS compatibility**, making it easier to procure receivers and utilize positioning information.[^1]
While Michibiki is sometimes called "Japan's GPS", it is not a complete replacement for GPS but rather a system that complements and augments it.[^1] [^2]

# Project Implementation Organizations
Michibiki is primarily a collaborative project involving Japan's **JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)** and various government ministries, including the Cabinet Office's **Space Development Strategic Promotion Secretariat**. However, operations are conducted through a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) approach, with **Quasi-Zenith Satellite System Services Inc. (QSS)** serving as the main operator.[^3]
From a policy perspective, the project is positioned within important national strategies such as the **"Basic Plan for the Promotion of Geospatial Information Utilization"** and the **"Basic Plan on Space Policy"**, and is promoted with strong national support.[^4]

# Project Timeline
In Japan, responding to the growing need for GPS-complementary positioning, the **"Quasi-Zenith Satellite System Development and Utilization Promotion Council"** was established in 2002 through public-private partnership.[^4]
Within this framework, discussions were held on topics such as "The ideal approach to developing and utilizing artificial satellites for positioning".[^5]
In September 2010, the first Michibiki satellite was launched, initially operated by JAXA.[^6]
Subsequently, in September 2011, the Cabinet formally decided to "establish a 4-satellite constellation and aim for a 7-satellite constellation".[^7][^8]
Furthermore, this project was positioned as one of the important policies in the **"Basic Plan on Space Policy"** announced in January 2013.[^6]
In fiscal year 2017, three additional satellites were launched, achieving the planned 4-satellite constellation.[^6]
The service was officially launched in November 2018, operating with the 4-satellite constellation launched by that time. At this point, three satellites became constantly visible from various locations across the Asia-Oceania region.[^1]
Subsequently, in fiscal year 2021, a successor to the first satellite was launched, and operations of the original first satellite were discontinued.[^6]
In December 2023, the roadmap of the **"Basic Plan on Space Policy"** was revised, outlining plans to launch satellites from fiscal year 2024 to 2025 toward establishing a 7-satellite constellation.[^6] The 7-satellite constellation operation is expected to begin in 2026.
Furthermore, this revised **"Basic Plan on Space Policy"** includes provisions to begin development of an 11-satellite constellation in the future. This plan aims to achieve robustness that enables positioning even if one of the seven satellites fails.[^9]

# Michibiki Use Cases
Applications of information obtained from Michibiki can be categorized into **positioning services** and **message transmission services**.[^2]
First, the use cases introduced on the official website for Michibiki include disaster-related message transmission services such as **"Disaster Crisis Management Satellite Communications System (Saiki-Tsuhou)"** and **"Q-ANPI"**.[^8]
"Saiki-Tsuhou" is a service that transmits crisis management information, such as disaster information during earthquakes and tsunamis issued by disaster prevention agencies, via Michibiki. "Q-ANPI" is a service that can transmit information about evacuation centers during disasters to control stations via Michibiki.[^8]
In April 2024, a new positioning augmentation service called **"MADOCA-PPP"** was launched, making high-precision positioning available throughout the Asia-Oceania region.[^8]
Furthermore, for private companies, centimeter-level positioning enabled by Michibiki is expected to contribute to surveying efficiency improvements and automation in construction and agriculture. However, as of 2025, these applications appear to be primarily in the demonstration phase.[^2]
Michibiki plans to operate a 7-satellite constellation in the future, and continued improvements in user positioning accuracy, sustainable positioning, and service area expansion are expected.[^7]
Additionally, an official app called **"GNSS View"** is provided to monitor the positioning status of positioning satellites, including Michibiki.[^10]

# Challenges for Michibiki
The development and operation of Michibiki are being carried out systematically with policy support from the Japanese government.
While the project has successfully navigated significant technical and financial challenges to date, continued efforts are needed to ensure its long-term success. From the perspective of accountability as a national project, more active promotion of utilization and dissemination will be necessary in the future.
In particular, increasing use cases that leverage centimeter-level positioning accuracy and GPS compatibility will be a future challenge.
Greater penetration into private industry sectors such as agriculture and mobility automation will likely be increasingly demanded.
Additionally, promoting utilization in neighboring countries where Michibiki's positioning information is available will also be required.
