# Overview
Since 2010, various geospatial information has been published as open data by the Japanese government and local governments.[^1]

It's not just government agencies and academia that have supported this proliferation. Citizen volunteers and technical communities also play important roles as both "creators" and "users" of geographic information.

As representative examples of such geographic information communities, this article introduces **OSGeo Japan**, which supports open source GIS, and the Japanese community of **OpenStreetMap**, a freely editable mapping project.

*Note: As of 2025, the websites related to Japan's OpenStreetMap community are divided into two: one for event and activity announcements, and another for the organizational management.*

# Two Representative Organizations in Japan's FOSS4G Community
Both **OSGeo Japan** and **OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan** are organizations that originated from international **FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial)** communities and have developed within Japan.
OSGeo Japan was established in 2006[^2], and OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan was founded in 2010. [^3]

These communities have worked to embed the use of open data and open source in Japanese society while collaborating with their international parent organizations and engaging with **diverse stakeholders including government agencies, private companies, research institutions, and citizens**.

Their activities can be said to have contributed not only to technology dissemination but also to the formation of a culture that utilizes geospatial information as a public resource.

## OSGeo Japan

As an **official Local Chapter of OSGeo**, OSGeo Japan operates with the purpose of promoting, educating, and facilitating information exchange about **open source GIS software such as QGIS, PostGIS, and MapLibre**.[^2]
Through various events including **FOSS4G Japan**, they have continuously provided numerous opportunities for interaction.

A notable point is that community events involving OSGeo Japan are held **nationwide rather than being concentrated in the Tokyo metropolitan area**.
In 2025 alone, distinctive regional events were held across wide areas of Japan including Kansai, Kyushu, Hokkaido, Kanto, and Shinshu regions.[^4]

Based on the author's own experience, these venues attract engineers from private companies, practitioners from civic organizations, academic researchers, and government officials as well.
Therefore, the technical know-how and practical examples shared at these events not only increase open data utilization cases but also influence **policy-level decision-making** such as the format and design philosophy of data published by local governments.

Additionally, while FOSS4G Global, the global conference hosted by OSGeo, had never been held in Japan until 2025, it has been decided that **it will be held in Hiroshima, Japan in 2026**.[^5]

## OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan
![OpenStretMap Japan Logo](/images/articles/eita-h/logo_OSMJ.webp) [^3]

Japan's OpenStreetMap community began mapping activities in 2008.[^3]
Since then, they have continuously held mapping events and study sessions, accumulating bottom-up information that cannot be captured by government-maintained maps.

In 2010, **OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan was established by community volunteers**. Subsequently, through emergency mapping support during **the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake** and hosting **State of the Map Global in Japan (Aizu-Wakamatsu, Fukushima Prefecture) in 2017**, their activities became recognized both domestically and internationally.[^3]
Based on these achievements, they were **officially recognized as a Local Chapter** by the UK-based OpenStreetMap Foundation in 2021.[^3]

Mapping activities remain active in recent years, with multiple collaborative projects with **Wikimedia Commons** implemented at major events such as **State of the Map Japan in 2025**.[^3]

Additionally, **State of the Map Global**, the global conference of the OpenStreetMap community, has been held in Japan twice: in **Tokyo in 2012** and in **Aizu-Wakamatsu (Fukushima Prefecture) in 2017**.[^3]

# Activity and Characteristics
A key characteristic of Japan's GIS community is that activities continue in various regions rather than being concentrated solely in Tokyo, the capital.
As shown in the "2025 Event Implementation Records" table below, both **OSGeo Japan** and **OpenStreetMap Foundation Japan** hold regionally-rooted events throughout the year across all regions of Japan from east to west, north to south.

## Strength of Regional Communities
An important point to emphasize is that these regional events are not merely scaled-down versions of larger gatherings. As mentioned earlier, regional events feature presentations on issues faced by each region and talks by community leaders who are based in local areas but have national achievements, demonstrating high levels of expertise in their content.

One symbolic event that demonstrates the strength of regional communities in Japan's FOSS4G events is the founding of MIERUNE, a GIS service company based in Hokkaido.[^6]
MIERUNE is a startup founded in 2016 by FOSS4G community engineers living in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost region, with FOSS4G HOKKAIDO serving as a catalyst.[^7]
Since then, this company has gained attention as a driving force in the spread of open source GIS not only in Hokkaido but throughout Japan.

## Inter-organizational Collaboration
Another noteworthy point is that different FOSS4G-related communities sometimes intersect at the same places and times, creating depth in Japan's GIS ecosystem.

For example, in January 2025, an OpenStreetMap/OpenData Meetup was held with the OpenStreetMap community participating in the "Open Source Conference," an open source festival.
Additionally, in February 2025, FOSS4G Hokkaido 2024 and State of the Map Japan 2024, OpenStreetMap's national conference, were held simultaneously in Sapporo, Hokkaido. (The event names include "2024" due to Japan's fiscal year convention ending in March.)
Although Sapporo, Japan's northernmost major city, experiences severe winter conditions during this period, it attracted a wide range of participants including local company engineers, government officials, civic organization practitioners, and university researchers, creating significant excitement.[^8]

# Future Challenges
While there is limited explicit discussion about challenges facing Japan's FOSS4G community, generally speaking, improving recognition and human resource development could be cited.

Japan has numerous open source technology communities. However, since FOSS4G communities are limited to the "Geospatial" field, they inevitably have smaller recognition and organizational scale compared to other general-purpose OSS communities. Therefore, as mentioned above, it would be important to increase exposure through active interaction with other communities.

Additionally, several major GIS companies well-known even outside the geospatial information field in Japan are not listed as FOSS4G community sponsors as of 2025.[^9]
To enhance activity sustainability and impact, gaining support from such large-scale and well-known GIS companies might also be important.

From a human resource development perspective, for example, OSGeo Japan promotes young engineers who show interest through event participation to important positions such as board members.[^2]
Since organizations led only by a few veteran members lack sustainability, such organizational development will be important for future continuous organizational management.

# Toward FOSS4G 2026 Hiroshima
As described above, Japan's OSGeo and OpenStreetMap communities can be said to form a distributed network where autonomous management teams emerge in each region and connect loosely with each other, rather than having a centralized structure. The human networks fostered at FOSS4G and mapping events across the country serve as the foundation supporting larger challenges.

Finally, I would like to touch upon an important event scheduled for 2026 as an international trend in OSGeo.

![FOSS4G 2026 Hiroshima Logo](/images/articles/eita-h/logo_foss4gHiroshima.webp) [^5]

FOSS4G is an abbreviation for Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial, and it is one of the world's largest international conferences hosted by OSGeo, a non-profit organization promoting the spread of open source GIS.
This FOSS4G Global conference has been decided to be held in Hiroshima, Japan in 2026. This will be the first time it is held in Japan.[^5]

The gathering of advocates for free and open geospatial information from around the world in Hiroshima, internationally known as a symbol of peace, represents both a culmination of the activities that Japan's FOSS4G community has built up over many years and a new starting point.
