Japan's Geographic Information System (GIS) has evolved since 1974, when the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan initiated the "National Land Numerical Information" project. This marked the beginning of GIS development primarily focused on infrastructure maintenance and disaster resilience. The 1980s saw local governments begin digitizing their urban planning maps, and the early 1990s brought the civilian use of GPS (Global Positioning System), laying further groundwork for advancement.

The 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake exposed critical challenges in Japan's geospatial data-sharing systems. Specifically, it revealed the limitations of paper-based map information sharing, the lack of interoperability between geographic data held by different agencies, and the difficulty in real-time disaster damage assessment. In response, the government took comprehensive steps to establish a national framework for GIS utilization.

# 1. Establishment of the GIS-Related Ministries Liaison Council and Early Initiatives (1999-2006)
In 1999, the Japanese government, led by the Cabinet Office, launched the GIS-Related Ministries Liaison Council[^1] to facilitate inter-agency collaboration on geospatial data sharing. This initiative marked the beginning of a national strategy to enhance GIS applications for disaster response and infrastructure management.

Subsequently, efforts were made to standardize geospatial information and establish sharing mechanisms through portal sites. In 2006, the concept of the Geospatial Information Platform G-Spatial Information Center[^2] was initiated, preparing the groundwork for more comprehensive utilization of geospatial information.

# 2. Enactment of the Basic Act on the Advancement of Utilizing Geospatial Information (2007)
Building on these early initiatives, the Basic Act on the Advancement of Utilizing Geospatial Information[^3] was enacted in 2007. This law provided a legal foundation for government-led geospatial initiatives, emphasizing the importance of nationwide data standardization, open access, and GIS-driven decision-making.

# 3. Formulation of the Basic Plan for the Advancement of Utilizing Geospatial Information (2008)
Following the enactment of the Basic Act, the Basic Plan for the Advancement of Utilizing Geospatial Information was introduced in 2008. This plan, building upon previous initiatives, outlined concrete policies for geospatial data development, management, and application, ensuring systematic progress in GIS implementation. Notable aspects included strengthening industry-academia-government collaboration and promoting technological development for advanced utilization of geospatial information.

# Evolution of Japan's Geospatial Policy
The GIS-Related Ministries Liaison Council was dissolved in 2005 after fulfilling its initial role, with subsequent organizations assuming responsibility for geospatial governance. Between 1995 and 2010, Japan's geospatial infrastructure development was largely government-driven, focusing on top-down policies and legal frameworks.

The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake marked a significant turning point in collaborative approaches to geospatial data management. This period saw the rapid advancement of crisis mapping, utilization of volunteer geographic information through platforms like OpenStreetMap (OSM), and promotion of open satellite data utilization. Furthermore, in 2018, the full-scale operation of the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System "Michibiki" began, enabling more precise positioning services.

In recent years, the importance of geospatial information in Society 5.0 has been recognized, with initiatives such as the 3D city model project (PLATEAU) and integration with smart city policies being promoted. Additionally, efforts are being made to explore more advanced applications of geospatial information, such as building digital twins for disaster prevention and mitigation. Along with government-led initiatives, community-driven contributions, citizen participation, and private-sector engagement have become integral to Japan's geospatial data ecosystem.

# Conclusion
Japan's geospatial information infrastructure has been shaped by a combination of legal, organizational, and technological advancements. From government-led GIS initiatives to more inclusive, citizen-driven approaches, Japan continues to refine its geospatial strategies to enhance disaster resilience, infrastructure management, and digital transformation.
