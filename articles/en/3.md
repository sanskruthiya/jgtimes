# From Local Governments to Citizen Co-Creation: The Era of Open Data GIS
Since 2010, Japan has seen a growing trend of local governments opening their data to the public under the Open Data initiative. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake played a pivotal role in accelerating this movement, highlighting the urgent need for accessible geographic information.

## The Impact of the 2011 Disaster on Open Data
In the aftermath of the earthquake, government and municipal geospatial data were not fully accessible, creating barriers to timely disaster response. However, volunteers and developers quickly mobilized, using OpenStreetMap (OSM) to create up-to-date maps of affected areas, aiding relief efforts.

At the same time, the rapid spread of information via social media and web platforms brought public awareness to the necessity of open data. This prompted the Japanese government to actively promote open data policies, encouraging local governments to make disaster-related and recovery data publicly available.

## The Rise of Open Source GIS and Civic Tech
This shift towards open data coincided with the rise of civic technology (Civic Tech), further driving the expansion of open geospatial information. Open-source GIS solutions, particularly those developed under the FOSS4G (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) movement, gained traction in Japan.

Organizations like OSGeo Japan have played a key role in promoting QGIS, PostGIS, MapLibre GL, and other open-source GIS technologies, facilitating their adoption by municipalities and private companies. OSGeo Japan also organizes FOSS4G conferences and workshops, fostering a community of developers and advancing GIS applications in public services and disaster management.

## OpenStreetMap as a Geospatial Foundation
Another key component of Japan’s open geospatial ecosystem is OpenStreetMap (OSM), a freely editable map database. OSM has been widely used for tourism maps, disaster response mapping, and municipal services. During major disasters like the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake, volunteer-driven OSM mapping efforts provided crucial real-time geographic data for rescue operations and recovery planning.

While the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI) provides official base maps, local governments are increasingly integrating OSM and LeafletJS into administrative services, making open-source GIS solutions a mainstream choice.

## The Role of Code for Japan
Founded in 2013, Code for Japan has been instrumental in bridging the gap between local governments, businesses, and citizens through open data-driven application development and data visualization. Many of their projects focus on geospatial information, leveraging datasets like GSI's "GSI Tiles" and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism’s 3D urban models from "PLATEAU".

One notable initiative was the COVID-19 Response Website, which visualized infection data on interactive maps, allowing citizens to grasp the situation intuitively.

## Future Prospects
With continued expansion of open data, advancements in FOSS4G technologies, and growing contributions from OSM and civic tech communities, the use of geospatial data in Japan is expected to accelerate. As municipalities and citizens collaborate more closely, innovative GIS-based services will emerge, contributing to a more resilient and sustainable society.
